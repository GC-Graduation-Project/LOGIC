ðŸŽµ Tab Notation Conversion System
Overview
Our project is a Tab Notation Conversion System, which utilizes YOLOv5 for sheet music recognition, basic-pitch for audio pitch detection, and mido for MIDI file handling. This application seamlessly converts recognized music sheets and audio into tab notations, facilitating musicians in generating accurate and readable tabs from both visual and audio inputs.

Features
Sheet Music Recognition: Uses YOLOv5 to identify and process sheet music.
Audio Pitch Detection: Employs basic-pitch for precise audio-to-pitch conversion.
MIDI Handling: Integrates mido for managing MIDI files and generating corresponding tabs.
